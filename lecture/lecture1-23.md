## How functional programming is different than imperative

you can do with functions what you can do with strings/ints

map takes a function, list and applies the function to the list

functional programming languages are better for pattern matching

immutable data structures

variables are names for substructures that can't be changed just used to make new things

type inference

polymorphism

## Pipe operator

you have to apply functions to transform data

f(g(h(w,b))) this is ugly

h(w,b) > g > f pipe operator

## Lambda Fxns

I want to transform elements of an array, let's add 5

functional programming allows us to use map

don't want to name it, put it in the global scope, don't wanna carry it around
    
syntactic construct that makes it a first class citizen

remove clutter from unnecessary fxns
