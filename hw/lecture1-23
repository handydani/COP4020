how functional programming is different than imperative

you can do with functions what you can do with strings/ints

map takes a function, list and applies the function to the list

functional programming languages are better for pattern matching

*immutable* data structures

variables are names for substructures that can't be changed just used to make new things

type inference

polymorphism
